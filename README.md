This is a small app that I created in order to try out NextJS. 

You can look up bible verses and click through to next/previous verse. The database is the sqlite db that I got from [scrollmapper's repo](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases). It's a great resource 
and I've used their mysql db on other projects.

Right now I'm only do lookups on the King James version, but I may expand to use some of the other versions at some point in the future. If time permits I may also add a 'related verse' feature. 

You can run it just like any other NextJS app...

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're all set.
